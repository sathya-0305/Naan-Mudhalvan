# Shopping Intention Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks

### Overview:
Understanding and predicting consumer shopping intentions is crucial for businesses to optimize marketing strategies and enhance customer experiences. Traditional methods may not effectively capture the complexities of consumer behavior, leading to inefficiencies in targeting and engagement. This project utilizes Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to develop a predictive model capable of accurately forecasting shopping intentions.

### Dataset: 

The dataset used for training and evaluation contains historical data on consumer behavior, demographic information, and online interactions. It is not included in this repository due to privacy and licensing restrictions. However, a sample dataset or instructions for obtaining the dataset can be provided upon request.

### Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sathya-0305/shopping-intention-prediction.git
   ```
2. Go to directory:   
   ```
   cd shopping-intention-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
### Usage:

1. Preprocess the data:
   ```
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Train the ANN model:
    ```
    python train.py
    ```
3. Evaluate the model:
   ```
   python evaluate.py
   ```
   
### Results:

The trained ANN model achieves an accuracy of X% on the validation set. Detailed evaluation metrics including precision, recall, and F1 score are provided in the results section of the project report.

### Future Enhancements:

- Integration of additional data sources such as social media interactions and location-based data.
- Exploration of advanced techniques including ensemble methods and deep learning architectures.
- Industry-specific customizations to tailor the model to specific business verticals.
